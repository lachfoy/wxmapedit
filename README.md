# wxmapedit
Small personal project for editing tile based maps using a custom binary format.
My goals for this project are to improve my C/C++ programming skills and learn a bit about native GUI applications, while hopefully creating a somewhat useful tool for my own tile based games. For this application I am using the wxWidgets framework.
